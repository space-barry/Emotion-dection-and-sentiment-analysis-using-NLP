# Depression and Anxiety Detection on Social Media

## Overview

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to detect signs of depression and anxiety in social media messages. By analyzing sentiment in text data, we aim to identify potential mental health concerns early, potentially helping individuals seek timely support.

## Project Structure

The project follows a 5-step process:

1. Data Gathering
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Analysis
4. Model Development
5. Model Testing and Analysis

## Data Sources

We use two primary datasets from Kaggle:
- [Sentimental Analysis for Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/gargmanas/sentimental-analysis-for-tweets)
- [Sentiment140 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140)

## Key Features

- Manual sentiment labeling and analysis
- Data cleaning using NLP techniques (stop word removal, lemmatization, etc.)
- Data visualization using WordClouds
- Machine Learning model for sentiment classification

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/space-barry/Emotion-dection-and-sentiment-analysis-using-NLP.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Emotion-detection-and-sentiment-analysis-using-NLP
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download the datasets and place them in the project directory.

## Usage

Run Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Open and run the notebooks in the following order:
1. Data_Gathering.ipynb
2. Data_Cleaning.ipynb
3. Data_Analysis.ipynb
4. Model_Development.ipynb
5. Model_Testing.ipynb

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance metrics:

- Accuracy: 0.77
- Macro Avg F1-Score: 0.78
- Weighted Avg F1-Score: 0.77
